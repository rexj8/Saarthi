            <div>
                <p>A volcano is an opening in the Earth’s crust that allows molten rock, gases, and debris to escape to the surface. Alaska, Hawaii, California, and Oregon have the most active volcanoes, but other states and territories have active volcanoes, too. A volcanic eruption may involve lava and other debris that can flow up to 100 mph, destroying everything in their path. Volcanic ash can travel 100s of miles and cause severe health problems. A volcanic eruption can:</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contaminate water supplies.</li>
                    <li>Damage machinery.</li>
                    <li>Reduce visibility through smog and harmful gases that may threaten low-lying areas.</li>
                    <li>Make it hard to breathe and irritate the skin, eyes, nose, and throat.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <br><br>
            <h2>IF YOU ARE UNDER A VOLCANO WARNING:</h2>
            <hr class="ruler">
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Listen for emergency information and alerts.</li>
                    <li>Follow evacuation or shelter orders. If advised to evacuate, then do so early.</li>
                    <li>Avoid areas downstream of the eruption.</li>
                    <li>Protect yourself from falling ash.</li>
                    <li>Do not drive in heavy ash fall.</li>
                    <li>Cloth masks help prevent the spread of COVID-19, but they will not adequately protect you from inhaling ash for longer periods of time like a respirator will. Respirators, like an N-95, are not meant to fit children. Due to COVID-19, it may be difficult to find respirators, such as N-95s.</li>
                    <li>Reduce your ash exposure by doing the following:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Limit your time outdoors and use a dust mask or cloth mask as a last resort.</li>
                        <li>Avoid areas downwind and river valleys downstream of the volcano.</li>
                        <li>Take temporary shelter from volcanic ash where you are.</li>
                        <li>Cover ventilation openings and seal doors and windows.</li>
                        <li>Avoid driving in heavy ash. If you must drive, keep the windows up and do not use the air conditioning system.</li>
                        <li>Do not get on your roof to remove ash.</li>
                        <li>If you have any breathing problems, avoid contact with ash and stay indoors until authorities say it is safe to go outside.</li>

            <h2>What are the other effects of global warming?</h2>
            <hr class="ruler">
            <div>Each year, scientists learn more about the consequences of global warming, and many agree that
                environmental, economic, and health consequences are likely to occur if current trends continue. Here’s
                just a smattering of what we can look forward to:</div>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Melting glaciers, early snowmelt, and severe droughts will cause more dramatic water shortages and
                    increase the risk of wildfires in the American West.</li>
                <li>Rising sea levels will lead to coastal flooding on the Eastern Seaboard, especially in Florida, and
                    in other areas such as the Gulf of Mexico.</li>
                <li>Forests, farms, and cities will face troublesome new pests, heat waves, heavy downpours, and
                    increased flooding. All those factors will damage or destroy agriculture and fisheries.</li>
                <li>Disruption of habitats such as coral reefs and Alpine meadows could drive many plant and animal
                    species to extinction.</li>
                <li>Allergies, asthma, and infectious disease outbreaks will become more common due to increased growth
                    of pollen-producing ragweed, higher levels of air pollution, and the spread of conditions favorable
                    to pathogens and mosquitoes.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            <h2> Where does the United States stand in terms of global-warming contributors?</h2>
            <hr class="ruler">
            <div>
                <p>In recent years, China has taken the lead in global-warming pollution, producing about 28 percent of
                    all CO2 emissions. The United States comes in second. Despite making up just 4 percent of the
                    world’s population, we produce a whopping 16 percent of all global CO2 emissions—as much as the
                    European Union and India (third and fourth place) combined. And America is still number one, by far,
                    in cumulative emissions over the past 150 years. Our responsibility matters to other countries, and
                    it should matter to us, too.</p>

                <p>Wondering how to stop global warming? Reduce your own carbon footprint by following a few easy steps.
                    Make conserving energy a part of your daily routine and your decisions as a consumer. When you shop
                    for new appliances like refrigerators, washers, and dryers, look for products with the government’s
                    Energy Star label; they meet a higher standard for energy efficiency than the minimum federal
                    requirements. When you buy a car, look for one with the highest gas mileage and lowest emissions.
                    You can also reduce your emissions by taking public transportation or carpooling when possible.</p>
