            <div>
                <p>A volcano is an opening in the Earth’s crust that allows molten rock, gases, and debris to escape to the surface. Alaska, Hawaii, California, and Oregon have the most active volcanoes, but other states and territories have active volcanoes, too. A volcanic eruption may involve lava and other debris that can flow up to 100 mph, destroying everything in their path. Volcanic ash can travel 100s of miles and cause severe health problems. A volcanic eruption can:</p>

                    <li>Contaminate water supplies.</li>
                    <li>Damage machinery.</li>
                    <li>Reduce visibility through smog and harmful gases that may threaten low-lying areas.</li>
                    <li>Make it hard to breathe and irritate the skin, eyes, nose, and throat.</li>
                </ul>

            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Listen for emergency information and alerts.</li>
                    <li>Follow evacuation or shelter orders. If advised to evacuate, then do so early.</li>
                    <li>Avoid areas downstream of the eruption.</li>
                    <li>Protect yourself from falling ash.</li>
                    <li>Do not drive in heavy ash fall.</li>
                    <li>Cloth masks help prevent the spread of COVID-19, but they will not adequately protect you from inhaling ash for longer periods of time like a respirator will. Respirators, like an N-95, are not meant to fit children. Due to COVID-19, it may be difficult to find respirators, such as N-95s.</li>

            <h2>How is global warming linked to extreme weather?</h2>
            <hr class="ruler">
            <div>
                <p>Scientists agree that the earth’s rising temperatures are fueling longer and hotter heat waves, more
                    frequent droughts, heavier rainfall, and more powerful hurricanes. In 2015, for example, scientists
                    said that an ongoing drought in California—the state’s worst water shortage in 1,200 years—had been
                    intensified by 15 percent to 20 percent by global warming. They also said the odds of similar
                    droughts happening in the future had roughly doubled over the past century. And in 2016, the
                    National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine announced that it’s now possible to
                    confidently attribute certain weather events, like some heat waves, directly to climate change.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The earth’s ocean temperatures are getting warmer, too—which means that tropical storms can pick up
                    more energy. So global warming could turn, say, a category 3 storm into a more dangerous category 4
                    storm. In fact, scientists have found that the frequency of North Atlantic hurricanes has increased
                    since the early 1980s, as well as the number of storms that reach categories 4 and 5. In 2005,
                    Hurricane Katrina—the costliest hurricane in U.S. history—struck New Orleans; the second-costliest,
                    Hurricane Sandy, hit the East Coast in 2012.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The impacts of global warming are being felt across the globe. Extreme heat waves have caused tens of
                    thousands of deaths around the world in recent years. And in an alarming sign of events to come,
                    Antarctica has been losing about 134 billion metric tons of ice per year since 2002. This rate could
                    speed up if we keep burning fossil fuels at our current pace, some experts say, causing sea levels
                    to rise several meters over the next 50 to 150 years.</p>

            <h2>What are the other effects of global warming?</h2>
            <hr class="ruler">
            <div>Each year, scientists learn more about the consequences of global warming, and many agree that
                environmental, economic, and health consequences are likely to occur if current trends continue. Here’s
                just a smattering of what we can look forward to:</div>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Melting glaciers, early snowmelt, and severe droughts will cause more dramatic water shortages and
                    increase the risk of wildfires in the American West.</li>
                <li>Rising sea levels will lead to coastal flooding on the Eastern Seaboard, especially in Florida, and
                    in other areas such as the Gulf of Mexico.</li>
                <li>Forests, farms, and cities will face troublesome new pests, heat waves, heavy downpours, and
                    increased flooding. All those factors will damage or destroy agriculture and fisheries.</li>
                <li>Disruption of habitats such as coral reefs and Alpine meadows could drive many plant and animal
                    species to extinction.</li>
                <li>Allergies, asthma, and infectious disease outbreaks will become more common due to increased growth
                    of pollen-producing ragweed, higher levels of air pollution, and the spread of conditions favorable
                    to pathogens and mosquitoes.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            <h2> Where does the United States stand in terms of global-warming contributors?</h2>
            <hr class="ruler">
            <div>
                <p>In recent years, China has taken the lead in global-warming pollution, producing about 28 percent of
                    all CO2 emissions. The United States comes in second. Despite making up just 4 percent of the
                    world’s population, we produce a whopping 16 percent of all global CO2 emissions—as much as the
                    European Union and India (third and fourth place) combined. And America is still number one, by far,
                    in cumulative emissions over the past 150 years. Our responsibility matters to other countries, and
                    it should matter to us, too.</p>

                <p>Wondering how to stop global warming? Reduce your own carbon footprint by following a few easy steps.
                    Make conserving energy a part of your daily routine and your decisions as a consumer. When you shop
                    for new appliances like refrigerators, washers, and dryers, look for products with the government’s
                    Energy Star label; they meet a higher standard for energy efficiency than the minimum federal
                    requirements. When you buy a car, look for one with the highest gas mileage and lowest emissions.
                    You can also reduce your emissions by taking public transportation or carpooling when possible.</p>
